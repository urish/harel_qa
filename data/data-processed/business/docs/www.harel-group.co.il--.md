## POLLUTION LIABILITY POLICY

This  policy  provides  coverage  on  a  discovery  and/or  claims-made  and  reported  basis depending upon the insuring agreements specifically listed as provided in Item 5 of the Declarations.  A "pollution event" must be first "discovered" and/or  a 'claim' must be first  made  against  an  'insured'  during  the  "policy  period"  and  such  "discovery"  or "claim"  must  be  reported  to  us  in  writing  during  the  'policy  period'  or  during  an applicable extended reporting period. Notice of a "potential claim' is not a 'claim' and does not trigger coverage under the policy.

This policy has certain unique provisions and requirements that may be different from other policies the "insured" may have purchased.  Coverage is provided only if the word YES appears in the column marked PROVIDED in the schedule set forth in Item 5 of the Declarations.   If the applicable Limits of Liability are exhausted, we shall not be liable  for  'claim  expenses'  or  for  any  "loss",  "cleanup  costs",  or  "other  loss"  which would  otherwise  be  covered  under  this  policy.  Read  the  entire  policy  carefully including any endorsements thereto to determine rights, duties, and what is and is not covered.

Throughout this policy, the words we, us and our refer to the company providing this insurance as identified in the Declarations.  Words and phrases that appear in quotation marks have special meaning.  Refer to DEFINITIONS (Section III).

## V. EXTENDED REPORTING PERIODS

## A. RENEWAL OF COVERAGE

Provided that the "named insured" has renewed this policy, the "named insured" shall be entitled to a provisional extended reporting period of sixty (60) days (at no additional charge) within which to report:

1. "Discovery"  during  the  final  thirty  (30)  days  of  the  "policy  period",  such provisional extended reporting period to commence upon the date of "discovery"; or
2. A "claim" that is first made against the "insured" during the final thirty (30) days of the "policy period", such provisional extended reporting period to commence upon the date the "claim" is made against the "insured".

Any  "discovery"  or  "claim"  reported  to  us  in  writing  during  the  provisional extended reporting period shall be deemed to have been made during the "policy period"  and  shall  be  subject  to  the  remaining  Limits  of  Liability  for  the  "policy period", if any.

## B. TERMINATION OF COVERAGE

Only with respect to "claims" seeking payment of "cleanup costs", 'loss", or "other loss" to which an insuring agreement specifically listed as provided in Item 5 of the Declarations applies, the "named insured" shall be entitled to:

1. An  automatic  extended  reporting  period  of  sixty  (60)  days  (at  no  additional charge) upon "termination of coverage".
2. Purchase  an  optional  extended  reporting  period  of  up  to  three  (3)  years  in duration  commencing  when  the  automatic  extended  reporting  period  ends, provided the "named insured":
3. (a) makes a written request to us for such optional extended reporting period within sixty (60) days after "termination of coverage"; and
4. (b) pays  the  additional  premium  when  due.    The  charge  for  such  optional extended reported shall not exceed one hundred percent (100%) of the total premium for the policy as set forth in Item 8 of the Declarations plus any additional premium described in an endorsement to the policy, if any.

At  the  commencement  of  any  such  optional  extended  reporting  period,  the entire  premium  shall  be  considered  earned,  and  in  the  event  the  optional extended reporting period is terminated before its expiration for any reason, we shall not return any portion of the premium paid.  If such additional premium is paid when due, the optional extended reporting period may not be canceled by us, provided that all other terms and conditions of the policy are met.

3. Any  'claim'  first  made  against  the  "insured"  and  reported  to  us  in  writing during the automatic extended reporting period or, as applicable, the optional extended reporting period shall be deemed to have been made and reported on the last day of the 'policy period' and coverage shall apply under this policy provided that:
2. (a) The  'pollution  event'  commenced  on  or  after  the  "retroactive  date"  and before the end of the 'policy period"; and
3. (b) The  "named  insured"  has  not  purchased  any  other  insurance  to  replace coverage provided by this policy; and
4. (c) The  'claim'  is  otherwise  covered  under  the  terms  and  conditions  of  this policy; and
5. (d) The "cleanup costs", "loss", or "other loss" resulting from such "claim"  will be subject to the remaining Limits of Liability for this policy, if any;  and
6. (e) Notwithstanding  CONDITIONS (Section VIII.),  OTHER INSURANCE, and Section V., B.3 (b), above, the insurance provided for a "claim" first reported during  the  automatic  extended  reporting  period  or  the  optional  extended reporting  period  is  excess  over  any  other  valid  and  collectible  insurance available under policies in force during the automatic or optional extended reporting periods.

## VI. LIMITS OF LIABILITY AND DEDUCTIBLE

## A.  EACH POLLUTION EVENT LIMIT

Subject to the Aggregate Policy Limit, the most we will pay for all 'cleanup costs', 'loss',  or  "other  loss"  arising  out  of  the  same,  continuous  or  repeated  "pollution event" or series of related "pollution events" is the Each Pollution Event Limit set forth in Item 3 of the Declarations.

We shall  not  be  obligated  to  pay  any  'cleanup  costs',  'loss',  or  "other  loss",  or undertake or continue the defense of any 'claim", pending or future, after the Each Pollution Event Limit has been tendered into court or exhausted by payments for 'cleanup costs', 'loss', or "other loss".

## B.  AGGREGATE POLICY LIMIT OF LIABILITY

The most we will pay for all 'cleanup costs', 'loss' and "other loss" to which this insurance  applies  is  the  Aggregate  Policy  Limit  set  forth  in  Item  3  of  the Declarations.

## C.  SUB-LIMIT OF LIABILITY/AGGREGATE SUB-LIMIT

If a sub-limit of liability is shown in Item 5 of the Declarations corresponding with a specific insuring agreement or in an endorsement to this policy, then, subject to the Each Pollution Event Limit and Aggregate Policy Limit set forth in Item 3 of the Declarations  and  the  corresponding  Aggregate  Sub-Limit,  such    sub-limit  of liability  is  the  most  we  will  pay  for  all  "cleanup  costs",  "loss",  or  "other  loss"  as applicable, arising from the same, continuous or repeated "pollution event" or series of related "pollution events" to which the specific insuring agreement or endorsement applies.  The corresponding Aggregate Sub-Limit is the most we will pay for all "cleanup costs", "loss", or "other loss", as applicable, under the terms of the  insuring  agreement  or  endorsement  to  which  that  Aggregate  Sub-Limit corresponds.

The  sub-limit  of  liability  is  not  in  addition  to  and  will  erode  the  Each  Pollution Event Limit and the Aggregate Policy Limit set forth in Item 3 of the Declarations. If the Each Pollution Event Limit and/or Aggregate Policy Limit has been reduced to  an  amount  which  is  less  than  the  sub-limit  of  liability  corresponding  with  a specific  insuring  agreement  or  in  an  endorsement,  the  lesser  of  the  remaining Aggregate Policy Limit or remaining Each Pollution Event Limit is the most that will be available for payment of "cleanup costs", "loss",  or "other loss" as applicable, to which to which that insuring agreement or endorsement applies.

<!-- image -->

## D.  DEDUCTIBLE

We will pay 'cleanup costs', 'loss', or "other loss" to which this insurance applies in  excess  of  the  Deductible  set  forth  in  Item  4  or  Item  5  (corresponding  with  an insuring  agreement  specifically  listed  as  provided)  of  the  Declarations  or  as  set forth  in  an  endorsement  to  this  policy,  if  any.    The  Deductible  is  the  "named insured's"  obligation  and  applies  to  all  "cleanup  costs',  'loss',  and  "other  loss" arising from the same, continuous or repeated "pollution event" or series of related 'pollution events".  The Deductible does not erode the Limits of Liability.  We may advance payment for 'cleanup costs', 'loss', or "other loss" within the Deductible. The  "named  insured"  shall  promptly  reimburse  us  for  advancing  any  element  of such 'cleanup costs', 'loss', or "other loss" paid by us within the Deductible. If an "insured" agrees with us to use non-binding mediation to resolve a 'claim' for which  a  defense  has  been  provided  and  such  'claim'  is  resolved  thereby,  the Deductible shall be reduced by 50% for that 'claim' only, subject to a maximum reduction of $25,000.

## E.  MULTIPLE INSUREDS OR CLAIMANTS, MULTIPLE COVERAGES, MULTIPLE POLICY PERIODS, CLAIMS ARISING FROM  POTENTIAL CLAIMS,  AND  CLAIMS  REPORTED  IN  THE  EXTENDED  REPORTING PERIOD

## 1.  MULTIPLE INSUREDS OR CLAIMANTS

The  inclusion  of  more  than  one  'insured'  in  the  "discovery"  of  a  "pollution event" or in the making of a 'claim' regarding the same 'pollution event' shall not increase the Limits of Liability set forth in Item 3 of the Declarations.  Nor shall the "discovery" of a "pollution event" or the making of 'claims' by more than  one  person  or  organization  increase  the  Limits  of  Liability  stated  in  the Declarations.

## 2.  MULTIPLE COVERAGES

If  the  same,  continuous  or  repeated  "pollution  event"  or  series  of  related "pollution events" is covered under more  than one insuring agreement specifically listed as provided in Item 5 of the Declarations, only a single Each Pollution Event Limit shall apply to all 'cleanup costs', 'loss', or "other loss" arising  from  such  "pollution  event"  or  series  of  related  "pollution  events". Furthermore,  if  more  than  one  Deductible  is  applicable,  only  the  highest Deductible shall apply to all 'cleanup costs', 'loss', or "other loss" arising from such "pollution event" or series of related "pollution events".

<!-- image -->

## 3.  MULTIPLE POLICY PERIODS

If  we  or  an  affiliate  have  issued  pollution  liability  coverage  to  the  "named insured" for the "covered location" in one or more consecutive and uninterrupted policy periods, and:

- (a) a "pollution event" or series of related "pollution events" that is first reported to us in accordance with all of the terms and conditions of this policy takes place over the "policy period" and one or more subsequent policy periods; and/or
- (b) a "claim" for "cleanup costs", "loss", or "other loss" is first made against the "insured" during the "policy period" and reported to us in accordance with all of the terms and conditions of this policy; and/or
- (c)  a  "pollution  event"  is  first  "discovered"  during  the  "policy  period"  and reported  to  us  in  accordance  with  all  of  the  terms  and  conditions  of  this policy;

all  "claims",  "cleanup  costs",  "loss",  and  "other  loss"  arising  out  of  the  same, continuous or repeated "pollution event" or series of related "pollution events" whether  reported  during  the  "policy  period"  or  during  a  subsequent  policy period shall be subject to the Limits of Liability and Deductible corresponding with this policy.

## 4.  CLAIMS ARISING FROM POTENTIAL CLAIMS

A "potential claim" which subsequently becomes a "claim" shall be subject to the Limits  of  Liability  corresponding  to  the  policy  period  in  effect  when  the 'potential claim' was reported to us in accordance with CLAIMS PROVISIONS (Section VII., Paragraph B. NOTICE OF POTENTIAL CLAIM).

## 5.  CLAIMS REPORTED IN THE EXTENDED REPORTING PERIOD

The extended reporting periods shall not serve to increase or reinstate the Limits of Liability set forth in Item 3 of the Declarations.  The Limits of Liability shall be those that remain at the end of the 'policy period".

<!-- image -->

## VII. CLAIM PROVISIONS

## A. NOTICE OF DISCOVERY OR CLAIM

In the event of a "discovery" or 'claim", the 'insured' shall give written notice to us as  soon  as  possible  containing  particulars  sufficient  to  identify  an  'insured'  and reasonably obtainable information including:

1. The  time,  place,  location,  and  a  detailed  explanation  of  the  'pollution  event' including,  as  applicable,  the  date  of  "discovery"  or  the  date  the  "insured" received the 'claim";
2. The names and addresses of any injured parties and available witnesses;
3. Any and all investigative or engineering reports, data or information about the 'pollution event", "cleanup costs", "loss", or "other loss"; and
4. Any  and  all  other  relevant  information  about  the  "pollution  event",  'claim', 'cleanup costs', 'loss', or "other loss".

If a 'claim' is made against an 'insured", the 'insured' shall immediately forward to  us  every  demand, notice, summons, complaint, order or other process or legal papers received by an 'insured' or its representatives.

## B.  NOTICE OF POTENTIAL CLAIM

If  during  the  'policy  period'  the  'insured'  first  becomes  aware  of  a  "potential claim",  the  'insured'  may  provide  written  notice  to  us  containing  particulars sufficient to identify an 'insured' and providing all of the following information:

1. The  cause  of  the  "new  pollution  event"  if  known  or  suspected,  including  any potential cause;
2. The time, place, location, and details of the "new pollution event" including how and when the 'insured' first became aware of the 'potential claim";
3. The  names  and  addresses  of  any  actually  or  potentially  injured  parties  or damaged  property,  and  available  witnesses,  if  and  to  the  extent  reasonably available;
4. Any and all investigative or engineering reports, data or information about the 'potential claim", and any other information containing "cleanup costs", 'loss', "natural resource damages" or "other loss" that may result; and
5. Any  other  relevant  information  about  the  'potential  claim",  "cleanup  costs", 'loss', "natural resource damages" or "other loss".

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

If  all  of  the  foregoing  information is provided to us in writing during the "policy period" and the "potential claim" subsequently becomes a 'claim' made against the 'insured' and reported to us during any renewal policy, any applicable extended reporting period, or within five (5) years after the later of the end of any such policy or extended reporting period, such "claim" shall be deemed, for the purposes of this insurance, to have been made on the date on which written notice of the 'potential claim'  was  first  received  by  us  and  shall  be  subject  to  the  terms,  conditions  and Limits of Liability applicable to the policy in effect as of such date.

We may elect to investigate any "potential claim" which is reported to us.  Any costs associated with the investigation of a "potential claim" prior to a "claim" being made will not be considered "claim expenses".  These costs shall not be applied towards reducing the  applicable  Deductible,  and  are  in  addition  to  the  Limits  of  Liability and shall be borne by us.

## C.  NOTICE TO US

All "discovery", 'claims' and "potential claims' shall be reported to us in writing at the address shown in Item 9 of the Declarations.

## D.  SETTLEMENT

The  'insured'  shall  not  settle  any  'claim'  without  our  written  consent.    If  we recommend a settlement, the 'insured' shall have the opportunity to concur, such concurrence  not  to  be  unreasonably  withheld  or  denied.    If  we  recommend  a settlement  that  is  acceptable  to  a  claimant  for  a  total  amount  in  excess  of  the applicable  Deductible  and  the  'insured'  refuses  to  concur  with  such  settlement, then our liability for 'cleanup costs", "loss", and 'other loss' shall be limited to that portion of the recommended settlement and the "claim expenses" incurred as of the date  of  the  'insured's'  refusal,  which  exceed  the  Deductible  and  fall  within  the Limit of Liability.

## E.  VOLUNTARY PAYMENTS, ADMISSIONS OR ASSUMPTIONS OF LIABILITY

No  costs,  charges  or  expenses  shall  be  incurred  or  paid  or  liability  admitted  or assumed  by  an  'insured'  without  our  written  consent,  which  shall  not  be unreasonably withheld, delayed or denied.

Notwithstanding  the foregoing, an 'insured'  may  incur  such  'emergency expense' as reasonably necessary to prevent or mitigate "cleanup costs', 'loss', or "other loss", provided the 'insured' provides written notice to us within ninetysix (96) hours after any portion of such "emergency expense" is incurred.

## VIII. CONDITIONS

## A. APPRAISAL

If we and the "insured" disagree as to the value of real property or improvements thereto in connection with "cleanup costs" (Section III.  DEFINITIONS, paragraph D.2) or the amount of "other loss" for Coverages H, I, and J (only if specifically listed as provided in Item 5 of the Declarations), either party may make written demand for  an  appraisal  of  the  value  of  the  property  or  the  amount  of  "cleanup  costs"  or "other  loss".    In  this  event,  each  party  will  select  a  competent  and  impartial appraiser.  The two appraisers will select an umpire.  If they cannot agree, either may request that selection be made by a judge of a court having jurisdiction.  The appraisers will state separately the value of the property and amount of "cleanup costs" or "other loss".  If they fail to agree, they will submit their differences to the umpire.  A decision agreed to by any two will be binding.  Each party will:

1. Pay its chosen appraiser; and
2. Bear the other expenses of the appraisal and umpire equally.

If there is an appraisal, we retain our right to deny coverage for "cleanup costs" or "other loss" as applicable.

## B. ASSIGNMENT

Assignment  of  interest  under  this  policy  shall  not  bind  us  unless  and  until  our consent  is  endorsed  thereon,  which  consent  shall  not  be  unreasonably  withheld, delayed or denied.

## C. AUDIT AND INSPECTION

We shall be permitted upon reasonable prior notice to audit the 'insured's' books and records at any time during the 'policy period' and within three (3) years after the final termination of this policy, as far as they relate to the subject matter of the policy  and  any  "cleanup  costs",  "loss",  or  "other  loss"  for  which  payment  may  be made under the policy.  We shall also be permitted, upon reasonable prior notice, to inspect,  sample  and  monitor  on  a  continuing  basis  any  'covered  location'  and operations conducted thereon.  Neither our right to make inspections, sample and monitor, nor the actual undertaking thereof, nor any report thereon shall constitute an undertaking, on behalf of us or others, to determine or warrant that a 'covered location'  or  operation  is  safe,  healthful  or  conforms  to  acceptable  engineering practice or is in compliance with any law, rule or regulation.  We will not manage or exercise control over any 'covered location' or operation.

<!-- image -->

## D. BANKRUPTCY

Bankruptcy or insolvency of an 'insured' will not relieve us of our obligations to an "insured" under this policy nor increase our obligations including, but not limited to,  those with respect to any Deductible amount.  However, if we have advanced any  payment  for  'cleanup  costs",  'loss",  or  "other  loss"  within  the  Deductible pursuant to LIMITS OF LIABILITY AND DEDUCTIBLE (VI., paragraph D), then any such payments to the extent not reimbursed to us shall reduce the Limits of Liability.    Furthermore,  this  condition  shall  not  impair  our  ability  to  assert  any defense on behalf of an "insured".

## E. CANCELLATION

1. This policy may be canceled by the "named insured" by surrender to us or by mailing  to  us  written  notice  stating  when  thereafter  cancellation  shall  be effective.
2. This  policy  may  be  canceled  by  us  by  mailing  to  the  "named  insured"  at  the address set forth in Item 1 of the Declarations, a notice stating when thereafter such cancellation shall be effective.  We may cancel this policy for the following reasons only in accordance with the dates agreed upon in paragraph 3 below:
- a. Fraud or material misrepresentation;
- b. Any  'insured's'  material  failure  to  comply  with  the  terms,  conditions  or contractual obligations under  this policy including  failure to pay  the Deductible when due (in accordance with the dates agreed upon);
- c. A  material  change  in  use  of,  or  operations  conducted  at,  any  "covered location"; or
- d. Nonpayment of premium (in accordance with the dates agreed upon, and subject to paragraph 3, below))
3. The mailing of notice as aforesaid shall be sufficient proof of notice.  The time of surrender or the effective date and hour of cancellation stated in the notice shall become the end of the 'policy period'.  Delivery of such written notice either by the "named insured" or by us shall be equivalent to mailing.  Notice of pending cancellation  will  be  provided  not  less  than:  (a)  sixty  (60)  days  prior  to  the effective  date  of  cancellation  for  any  'insured's'  failure  to  comply  with  the terms, conditions or contractual obligations under this policy including failure to pay the Deductible when due, or change in use of, or operations conducted at the  "covered  location"  that  materially  increases  risks  to  which  this  insurance applies; (b) thirty (30) days prior to the effective date of cancellation for fraud or material misrepresentation; (c) thirty-six (36)  days  following  our  written notification to the "insured" that payment  of  the premium  is  overdue. Notwithstanding cancellation pursuant to this paragraph 3(c):

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

- (i) Any amount not paid timely shall bear interest differentials, as published by the Bank of Israel, for the overdue period, which shall be paid to the us at the time of settling the sum overdue and as an integral part thereof
- (ii) Cancellation  of  the  insurance  under  the  terms  of  this  clause  shall  not adversely affect the "insured's" duty to settle the amount overdue relating to  the  period  up  to  the  aforementioned  cancellation,  including  our expenses.
- (iii) Cancellation of insurance as aforementioned shall not adversely affect the rights  of  any  "claim"  under  the  Policy  in  respect  of  "pollution  event" which occurred prior to the cancellation of the insurance, if the "claim" is reported to us in writing during an applicable extended reporting period.
4. If  we  cancel,  subject  to  any  minimum  earned  premium  that  may  apply,  the return premium will be calculated on a 'pro rata' basis.  If the "named insured" cancels, subject to any minimum earned premium that may apply, there may be no  return  premium  or  the  return  premium  will  be  calculated  on  a  'pro  rata' basis.

## F. CHANGES

The terms of this  policy  shall  not  be  waived  or  changed,  except  by  endorsement issued to form a part of this policy.

## G. CHOICE OF LAW

In the event an 'insured' and we dispute the meaning, interpretation or operation of any term, condition, definition or provision of this policy resulting in litigation, arbitration or other form of dispute resolution, the 'insured' agrees with us that the law of Israel and the Israeli courts law shall have sole jurisdiction in any dispute arising there from.  Unless otherwise provided in this policy, the provision of the law  of  Insurance  Contract  -  1981  shall  apply  to  all  matters  connected  with  this policy insofar as the matter shall oblige.  In the event the 'insured' agrees with us to  resolve  the  dispute  by  arbitration,  any  such  arbitration  shall  be  in  accordance with the Arbitration Law 1968 (Israel) and any statutory modification of such law.

## H. COOPERATION

The  'insured'  agrees  with  us  to  assist  and  cooperate  in  the  fulfillment  of  the policy's terms, including the investigation, adjustment, defense or settlement of any 'claim"  or  in  connection  with  the  "discovery"  of  any  "pollution  event".    Such cooperation may include participating at meetings; testifying at hearings, depositions and trials; and securing evidence.  The 'insured' shall be allowed $250 per day but no more than $5,000 in total allowable expenses for compensation to its principals,  partners,  officers,  directors,  employees    or  members  or  managers  for personally  attending  any  such  meetings,  hearings  or  depositions  at  our  request.

<!-- image -->

These  allowable  expenses  shall  not  reduce  the  applicable  Limits  of  Liability  and Deductible set forth in Item 3 of the Declarations.

In  addition,  all  "insureds"  shall  cooperate  with  us  in  the  pursuit  of  any  coverage that may be available from other insurers and/or under other insurance policies for "claim expenses", "cleanup costs", "loss", or "other loss", covered under this policy.

## I. DECLARATIONS

By acceptance of this policy, the "named insured" agrees that the statements in the Declarations, and those made during the application process and in the Application are  its  agreements  and  representations, that this policy is issued in reliance upon the truth of such statements and representations and that this policy embodies all agreements existing between the "named insured" and us relating to this insurance.

## J. HEADINGS

The descriptions in the headings of this policy are solely for convenience and form no part of the policy terms and conditions.

## K. OTHER INSURANCE

1. The  insurance  provided  under  this  policy  is  primary  insurance,  except  as otherwise provided in connection with any extended reporting period, or where stated in an endorsement to apply in excess of, or contingent upon the absence of, other insurance.  When this insurance is primary and the 'insured' has other insurance  which  is  stated  to  be  applicable  to  the  'cleanup  costs',  'loss',  or "other loss" on an excess basis, the amount of our liability under this policy shall not be reduced by the existence of such excess insurance.
2. When this insurance is excess, we shall have no duty to defend the "insured" against  any  "claim"  if  any  other  insurer  has  a  duty  to  defend  the  "insured" against such "claim".  If no other insurer defends, we will undertake to do so, but  we  will  be  entitled  to  the  insured's  rights  against  all  those  other  insurers. When this insurance is excess over other insurance, we will pay only our share of the amount of 'cleanup costs', 'loss', or "other loss" if any, that exceeds the sum of:
- a. The total amount that all such other insurance would pay for the 'cleanup costs', 'loss', or "other loss" in the absence of this insurance; and
- b. The  total  of  all  deductible  and  self-insured  amounts  under  all  that  other insurance.

<!-- image -->

3. When  both  this  insurance  and  other  insurance  apply  to  the  'cleanup  costs', 'loss', or "other loss" on the same basis, whether primary, excess or contingent, we shall not be liable under this policy for a greater proportion of the 'cleanup costs", or "other loss" than the amount set forth in Item 3 of the Declarations or the  amount  resulting  from  the  following  contribution  methods,  whichever  is lesser:
- a. Contribution by equal shares - Under this approach each insurer contributes equal amounts until it has paid its applicable limit of insurance or none of the 'cleanup costs', 'loss', or "other loss" remains, whichever occurs first; or
- b. Contribution  by  limits  -  each  insurer's  share  is  based  on  the  ratio  of  its applicable limit of insurance to the total applicable limits of insurance of all insurers.

## L. SEPARATION OF INSUREDS

Except with respect to the Limits of Liability and any rights and duties specifically assigned  to  the  "named  insured"  set  forth  in  Item  1  of  the  Declarations,  this insurance applies:

1. As if each "named insured" were the only "named insured"; and
2. Separately to each 'insured' against whom a 'claim' is made.

Misrepresentation, concealment, breach of condition or violation of any duty under this policy by one 'insured' shall not prejudice the interest of coverage for another 'insured' under this policy, except where an "insured" is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliate of the "named insured" set forth in Item 1 of the Declarations.  For purposes of the immediately preceding sentence, an "affiliate" is any company or entity that is in  control  of,  controlled  by,  or  under  common  control  with  the  "named  insured". "Control" (including the terms  "controlled by'' and "under common control with'') as used herein includes, but is not limited to, the possession, directly or indirectly and whether acting alone or in conjunction with others, of the authority to direct or cause the direction of the management or policies of a company or entity.  A voting interest of twenty five percent (25%) or more creates a rebuttable presumption of control.

## M. SOLE AGENT

The "named insured" set forth in Item 1 of the Declarations shall act on behalf of all 'insureds' for all purposes, including but not limited to the payment of Deductible, payment or return of premium, receipt and acceptance of any endorsement issued to  form  a  part  of  this  policy,  giving  and  receiving  notice  of  cancellation  or nonrenewal, and the exercise of the rights provided in EXTENDED REPORTING PERIODS (Section V.)

## N. SUBROGATION

In the event of any payment under this policy, we shall be subrogated to all of an 'insured's'  rights  of  recovery  against  any  person  or  organization,  including  any rights  to  contribution  from  any  other  insurer.    An  'insured'  shall  execute  and deliver instruments and papers and do whatever else is necessary to secure such rights.  No 'insured' shall do anything to impair, prejudice or waive such rights. Any  recovery  obtained  through  subrogation,  after  expenses  incurred  in  such subrogation  are  deducted  by  the  party  bearing  the  expense,  shall  be  applied proportionately to the "insured" and us for actual payments as a result of judgment, settlement or defense of a 'claim", or "cleanup costs" with respect to the "discovery" of a "pollution event".

## O. THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES

No third party beneficiaries are created as a result of this policy.  This policy creates no rights by or on behalf of any third parties.  We have no obligation under this policy to any third party whatsoever and specifically we have no obligation to make payment to anyone except the "insured".
