## 9.26 Reinstatement

- 9.26.1 The insurer may, at its discretion, reinstate or replace the damaged or destroyed property, or any part thereof, instead of paying the sum of the loss or damage, or will be entitled to participate with any other insurer or insurers in doing so.

In the event that the insurer chooses to reinstate or replace any property, the insured shall provide the insurer with the plans, specifications, measurements, quantities and all other details as the insurer may require, and none of the actions taken or caused to be taken by the insurer with the intention of reinstatement or replacement, shall be interpreted as the insurer's choice to reinstate or replace the damage.
